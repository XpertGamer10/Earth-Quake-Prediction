    <h1>About the Earthquake Predictor Project</h1>
    <p>This project is designed to help assess earthquake risks by analyzing the Richter scale magnitude. By entering
        location data (latitude and longitude) and the depth of an event, users can receive a prediction on the
        earthquake's potential magnitude and severity, along with precautionary guidance.</p>
